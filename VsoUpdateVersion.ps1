# Script to set the buildNumber to a Nuget/NuSPec compatible Semantic version
# Nuget doesn't fully support full semantic version numbers. In particular, it
# doesn't support use of the '.' in parts after a '-' is used. So, this creates
# a semantic version number that uses additional '-' characters instead of '.'
#
# For details on the general algorithm used for computing the numbers here see:
# https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.assemblyversionattribute.assemblyversionattribute(v=vs.110).aspx 
# The only difference from the AssemblyVersionAttribute algorithm is that this
# uses UTC for the reference times, thus ensuring that all builds are consistent
# no matter what locale the build agent or developer machine is set up for.
